# Computer-Vision-Hard-Coded-Coin-Counter
This computer vision project is a hard coded approach to counting coins.

The program was tailored to work with ten different images of coins, which were uploaded to the ipynb notebook and the apporach
taken was to tailor the settings of the program to the images where the most coins were present, to maximize successful results.

The coin counting program worked successfully for the first set of images which were uploaded and gradually decreased in efficiency as the
circumstances and envrionment of the images changed.

I hypothesised that in order to create a hard coded coin counting program which returns results which are 98%+ efficient, the circumstances of the photographs
which were uploaded to the program would have to remain constant.

The camera quality, which is used to capture images has a significant baring on the ability to count the coins and therefore to create an effective program,
high quality photographs would need to be captured to facilitate the program.

The saturation at the center of the coin, saturation at the side of the coin and the size of the coin (pixels) are the main factors which are used to
differenciate between the different coin denominations. Therefore it is imperative that to count the coins accurately, the distance from the coins to the
camera capturing the coins must remain consistent. Additionally - the lighting conditions have an intense effect on coin discrimination, as the saturation values
which are programmed into the code change significantly and if brightness is increased or decreased from the reference point used in program design, it will result
in the program returning results which are effectively inaccurate.
